# Airline-Reservation-System
- Designed and implemented a relational database system for an airline reservation platform, including ERD modeling, normalization, and support for user roles, bookings, flights, and baggage.

- Applied advanced database concepts such as weak entities, foreign key constraints, and complex relationships (1:1, 1:M, M:N) to ensure data integrity and real-world system simulation.
